## Aviator Game Guide: How to Play

The **Aviator game** is unique and thrilling. Players make a bet and
then wait for the airplane to ascend. Your goal is to cash out before
the plane flies off the screen, with the multiplier rising as the plane
ascends. The higher the multiplier, the more you win. However, timing is
everything, as the plane can crash at any moment.

Here's a step-by-step guide to playing:

### 1. **Make Your Bet**

Choose the amount you want to bet. You can either bet a single amount or
double your bet by placing two bets in one round.

### 2. **Wait for the Plane to Ascend**

Once the round begins, the airplane starts taking off. The multiplier
increases gradually as the plane ascends.

### 3. **Cash Out**

Before the plane crashes, you must decide when to cash out. If you cash
out too early, you may get a smaller payout. But if you wait too long,
the plane may crash, and you lose your stake.

### 4. **Repeat**

After each round, you can either end your session or start another one.
